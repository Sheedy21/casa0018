## Introduction

Face recognition is a system that has gained more attention in last years due to the capacity that this technology has to identify the human face. To achieve this, it is necessary to have a set of images to train the model considering the different factors like the model, data size, image size, etc. that can help us to get a more accurated object detector. However, what if we have an image or video frame that no contains the whole face, will it be possible to recognize that as a face. For this reason, I use the Object Detection API to recognize some parts of the face as a first step to detect a face in an image. This model can help us also to recognize people who are using masks or glasses. Whit these results, we can get the exact number of people that are in a specific space. And then, it can be extended to consider the same method to identify different objects. To give a simple example that can reflect the importance of this work is the use of our smartphones that are not able to recognize a face if it is showed parcially.

- an overview of what the project does
- your inspiration for making the project 
- examples that it is based on. 

*probably ~200 words and images are good!*

## Research Question

The research question of this work is how to identify a human face from an image or video frame more accurately.

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data

Tha data use on this project was downloaded from Google images using the Image Downloader extension 
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
